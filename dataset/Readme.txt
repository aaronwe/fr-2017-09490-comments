	“This count refers to the total comment/submissions 
	received on this document, as of 11:59 PM [5/25/2017]. 
	Note: Agencies review all submissions, however some 
	agencies may choose to redact, or withhold, certain 
	submissions (or portions thereof) such as those 
	containing private or proprietary information, 
	inappropriate language, or duplicate/near duplicate 
	examples of a mass-mail campaign. This can result in 
	discrepancies between this count and those displayed 
	when conducting searches on the Public Submission 
	document type. For specific information about an 
	agency’s public submission policy, refer to its 
	website or the Federal Register document.’
